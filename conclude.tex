\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper we summarized two of our recent results in addressing the fundamental tension
between latency and consistency in geo-replicated systems. First,
RedBlue consistency~\cite{Li2012RedBlue} offers fast geo-replication by
presenting sufficient conditions that allow programmers to safely separate
weakly consistent (fast) operations from strongly consistent (slow) ones in
a coarse-grained manner. To increase the space of potential fast operations
and simplify the programmer's task of defining commutative operations, 
we propose the use of conflict-free replicated data types. Second,  Explicit Consistency~\cite{Balegas2015Indigo}
enables programmers to make fine-grained decisions on consistency level assignments
by connecting application invariants to ordering conflicts between pairs of operations,
and explores efficient reservation techniques for coordinating conflicting operations with
low cost.

%Our first work, RedBlue consistency~\cite{Li2012RedBlue}, enables blue
%operations to be fast (and eventually consistent) while
%the remaining red operations are strongly consistent
%(and slow). 
%We have discussed the conditions when operations
%can be blue and must be red.
%To increases the space of potential blue operations
%and simplify the programmer's task of defining commutative operations, 
%we propose the use of conflict-free replicated data types.
%Our second work, Explicit Consistency~\cite{Balegas2015Indigo}, 
%further increases the space of operations that can be fast by 
%only restricting the concurrent execution of the operations that can break
%application-defined invariants.
%We propose a methodology to, from the application-defined invariants, 
%deploy a reservation system that allow operations to complete locally in the
%common case, by moving coordination off the critical path of operation execution.

%Main parts of this paper are from two papers: ~\cite{Li2012RedBlue} and ~\cite{Balegas2015Indigo}.


%NOTE: the description of redblue and explicit in abstract and conclusion looks very similar. 
%bibliography needs to be fixed.... I have just copied the bib file from indigo paper to the end of our bib file... some references may be duplicated.
