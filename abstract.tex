Geo-replicated storage systems are at the core of current Internet services.\ Unfortunately, 
there exists a fundamental tension between consistency and performance for offering scalable 
geo-replication. Weakening consistency semantics leads to less coordination and consequently
a good user experience, but it may introduce anomalies such as state divergence and invariant violation.\ In 
contrast, maintaining stronger consistency precludes anomalies but requires more coordination.\ This 
paper discusses two main contributions to address this tension.\ First, RedBlue Consistency 
enables blue operations to be fast (and weakly consistent) while the remaining red operations 
are strongly consistent (and slow).\ We identify sufficient conditions for determining when 
operations can be blue or must be red.\ Second, Explicit Consistency further increases the space 
of operations that can be fast by restricting the concurrent execution of only the operations 
that can break application-defined invariants.\ We further show how to allow operations to complete 
locally in the common case, by relying on a reservation system that moves coordination off the 
critical path of operation execution.

%Main parts of this paper are from two papers: ~\cite{Li2012RedBlue} and ~\cite{Balegas2015Indigo}.

%In this paper, we introduce two pieces of our prior work defining a set of principles for
%reducing the amount of required coordination for geo-replicated systems by taking into account
%two important properties, namely state convergence and invariant preservation~\cite{Li2012RedBlue} and ~\cite{Balegas2015Indigo}.
